Log All The Things

When you are managing a website it is important to be able to determine the type and frequency of visitors. One way to do that is by reviewing the log files on the server. The logs will tell you a bit about each incoming requests. Examples of the type of information that are found in logs include the browser (user-agent) for each visitor, the files requested, and a time stamp when the request was made. A system administrator can determine if errors are occuring, whether traffic appears to be normal, or if the server is being attacked by bots.

In this project build own custom logger that log some information about each request it recieves.
